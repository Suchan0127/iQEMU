# Native QEMU on iOS
Run Native QEMU on iOS



❗REQEUIREMENTS❗

If you are planning to follow this Tutorial, first You need to BE JAILBROKEN With Checkra1n.

Also, you need to install Procursus Bootstrap and Sileo with Betelguese (https://github.com/23Aaron/Betelguese)

If you have downloaded Sileo with Betelguese, search for NewTerm2 and Filza File Manager and install it.


## 1) Choose the Version of QEMU you want to install
There are two versions of QEMU you can install, QEMU 4.2.0 and QEMU 5.2.0

QEMU 4.2.0 is suitable for old Windows like XP and Vista (i386), and QEMU 5.2.0 is suitable for Modern Windows Like 7, 8, 8.1.
I recommend Windows 7.

## 2) QEMU 4.2.0

### 1.
```

```
.deb provided by https://blog.jrcloud.vip/index.php/archives/95/
If you downloaded ```qemu_4.2.0_iphoneos-arm.deb```, copy it to Filza or Sileo to install it.

### 2.
Open NewTerm2 and type ```qemu-system-x86_64```

If no error occured and it reports something about vnc server, you had succeed to download QEMU 4.2.0 on your Device!

## 2) QEMU 5.2.0
❗NOTE YOU SHOULD INSTALL SILEO WITH BETELGEUSE (CONTAINS PROCURSUS BOOTSTRAP)❗
